# Best Books

Best Books helps users answer the question "what should I read today?" The app takes years of "books of the year" award data from publications such as the New York Times and The Economist (among others) and gives users an easy way to browse or search through the data to discover books that they should read. Having the data in one place allows the users to see things like all awards a book has received or all award winning books written by an author. 

The app improves the original award data by pulling in book and author information and book reviews from the GoodReads API.

Best Books was created as a Final Project at Hackbright Academy.
